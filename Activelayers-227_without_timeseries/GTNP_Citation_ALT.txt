Data Policy
Kindly contact the appropriate Principal Investigators (PIs) of the chosen data sets and inform them how you are using soil temperature (TSP) and active layer (CALM) data and if you are planning a publication. If the PIs feel that they should be acknowledged or offered participation as authors, they will let you know, and we assume that an agreement on such matters will be reached prior to publishing and/or use of the data for publication. If your work directly competes with the PIs analysis, they may ask to have the opportunity to submit a manuscript before you submit the one that uses their data. In addition, when publishing a paper using permafrost data, please acknowledge the agency that supported the permafrost research.
