Description:  
	DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	Wide subarctic valley floor.  Wet tussock tundra
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1 ha grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 10 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water..
