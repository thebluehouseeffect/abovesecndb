Description: DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	Franklin Bluff grid is located on the inner coastal plain wth river terraces.  Landcover units include Graminoid-moss tundra and graminoid, prostrate-dwarf-shrub, moss tundra (wet and moist nonacidic).
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1 ha grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 10 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water.
	DATA
	Only thaw depth data determined by mechanical probing is reported on CALM website. For additional data refer to http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/Permafrost-lab/index.html or contact site investigators directly 
	Additional Climate data are also available at http://www.uaf.edu/water/projects/NorthSlope/coastal_plain/betty/betty.html
