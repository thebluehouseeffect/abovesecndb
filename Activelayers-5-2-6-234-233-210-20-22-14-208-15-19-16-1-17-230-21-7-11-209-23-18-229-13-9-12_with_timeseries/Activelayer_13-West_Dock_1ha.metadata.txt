Description: DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	West Dock grid is located on the outer Arctic Coastal Plain within the Prudhoe Bay oil field. The polygonized ‘‘uplands’’ and drained thaw-lake basins constitute the primary relief at these sites. Landcover units include Graminoid-moss  tundra (wet nonacidic). U4 1-ha grid is located within drained lake basin portion of the U5 (West Dock) 1 km grid.
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1 ha grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 10 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water.
	DATA
	Only thaw depth data determined by mechanical probing is reported on CALM website. For additional data refer to http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/Permafrost-lab/index.html or contact site investigators directly.
	Additional Climate data are also available at http://www.uaf.edu/water/projects/NorthSlope/coastal_plain/west_dock/west_dock.html
