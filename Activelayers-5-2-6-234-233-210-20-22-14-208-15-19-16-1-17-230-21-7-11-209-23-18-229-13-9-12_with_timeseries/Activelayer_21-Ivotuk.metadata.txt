Description:  
	DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	The Ivotuk study area is located on the North Slope of Alaska, in the central southern coastal plains north of the Brooks Range (Lat: 68* 29' N, Long:155* 44' W). It is flanked on the west by Iteriak Creek and the Ivotuk Hills, and on the east by Otuk Creek. The airstrip and short road at the site were originally developed for geologic exploration in the early 1980's. The study area itself was officially established in 1998 as part of the Arctic Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System (ATLAS) project.
	 The 1 km x 1km CALM IVOTUK grid is primarely located on the first and second terrace of Otuk creek . The second terrace is caracterized by prediminatly tasocky Moist Asidic Tundra with shraby watertracks on slopes. The first terrace is characterozed by flat Moist Nonacidic Tundra.
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1-sq km grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 100 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water.
	During 1998-2002 The IVOTUK site was a subject of The Arctic Transitions in the Land-Atmosphere System (ATLAS) Project, a coordinated program that examined the geographical patterns and controls over climate-land surface exchange and develop reasonable scenarios of future change in the Arctic. The compilation of information and measurements made at the Ivotuk site on the North Slope of Alaska during 2.5 year period from 1998 through June 2000 is available at http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/atlas/ivotuk_cd/html/IvotukFrameset.htm. The data include results of detailed vegetation, soil, climatologic, and hydrologic investigations.
	Up-to-date climate and soil metadata/data for two installations within CALM Ivotuk grid is also available at http://www.uaf.edu/water/projects/atlas/ivotuk/ivotuk.html
