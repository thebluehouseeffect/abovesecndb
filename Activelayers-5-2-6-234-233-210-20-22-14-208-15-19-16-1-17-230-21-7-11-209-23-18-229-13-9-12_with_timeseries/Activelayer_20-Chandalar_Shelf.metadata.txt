Description:  
	DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	Broad glaciated mountain valley.  Landcover units include Graminoid-moss tundra and graminoid,  prostrate-dwarf-shrub, moss tundra (wet and moist nonacidic). The site is located at the southern slope of Brooks Range
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	100-m grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 10 m. Sampling was conducted by manual probing at each stake. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or large water ponds.
	DATA
	Only thaw depth data determined by mechanical probing is reported on CALM website. For additional data refer to http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/Permafrost-lab/index.html or contact site investigators directly
Data Author: Vladimir E. Romanovsky
Observation: 
	Landform: Glaciated mountain terrace
	Lithology: Ruptic-Histic Aquiturbel. Organic layer thickness is 27 cm
	Vegetation: Alpine meadow with low shrubs
	Vegetation_Name: Shrub Tundra
