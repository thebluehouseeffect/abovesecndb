Description:  
	DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	West Dock grid is located on the outer Arctic Coastal Plain within the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Contrasts between polygonized ‘‘uplands’’ and drained thaw-lake basins constitute the primary relief at these sites, and lakes and ponds are ubiquitous elements of the landscape. Landcover units include moist nonacidic tundra and wet tundra vegetation, and Typic Aquorthel soils developed in alluvium [Walker and Bockheim, 1995]. Two drained thaw-lake basins occupy the eastern half of the grid and are separated from the upland to the west by a prominent beach ridge. A network of low-centered icewedge polygons is developed on the ponded tundra upland (Hinkel & Nelson, 2003).
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1-sq km grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 100 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water.
	Two soil climate station was established in August of 2001 in two representative landscapes within the CALM grid. The “U5(west dock) Low” station represents drained lake basin. The “U5(west dock) High” station represents poligonized uplands.  The elevation for U5low is about 1.5 m (5 ft). The elevation for U5high is about 3 m (10 ft).  Each station monitors air temperature, solar and net radiation, wind speed and direction, and soil temperature at various depths to a maximum of 120 cm. Measurements are made at 20-minute intervals and averaged and recorded every hour.
