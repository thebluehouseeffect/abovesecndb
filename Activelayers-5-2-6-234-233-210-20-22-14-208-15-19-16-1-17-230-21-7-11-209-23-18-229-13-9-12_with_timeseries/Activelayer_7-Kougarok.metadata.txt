Description: 1-sq km grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 100 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water.
	Kougarok 3m Grid met tower (65o27,500' N, 164o 38,279 W), about 100 m west of the west site of the grid on the south facing slope.Climate station has 12 thermistors in the ground ranging from 0-125 cm. Station has 6 soil moisture probes ranging from 5-35 cm depth.
