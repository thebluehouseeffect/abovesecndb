Description: DESCRIPTION OF AREA CONTAINING SITE:
	The Imnavait Creek site encompasses a north-south trending stream valley, much of the valley’s slopes, and an adjoining hill crest. Wet acidic tundra with a thick organic mat occupies the valley bottom. The higher elevations are occupied by moist acidic tundra, but the slopes are broken by numerous water tracks that become more prominent downslope (McNamara et al., 1999). These narrow zones contain shrub vegetation, especially willow (Hinkel & Nelson, 2003).
	SAMPLING DESIGN AND METHOD: 
	1-sq km grid consists of a square array of surveyed permanent stakes separated by 100 m, yielding an 11 × 11 array of sampling nodes on each grid. Thaw depth and snow sampling was conducted twice by manual probing at each stake. The two values for each sampling point are averaged, yielding a maximum of 121 data points per grid per probing date. The active layer was not measured at locations where grid points intersect rocks or deep water.
	Additional climate snow and hydrologic data are also available at http://www.uaf.edu/water/projects/NorthSlope/imnavait/imnavait.html
